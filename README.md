<h4>Data Cleaning:</h4>
<p>1. Handle missing values by filling or dropping them appropriately.</p>
<p>2. Correct data types, such as converting date columns to datetime objects.</p>
<p>3. Identify and handle outliers to ensure data quality.</p>

<h4>Data Visualization:</h4>
<p>-> Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create charts and graphs that illustrate patterns and trends in the data.</p>
<p>-> Visualize the distribution of bookings across different months, days of the week, and hotel types.</p>
<p>-> Plot the cancellation rates and analyze factors affecting cancellations.</p>

<h4>Finding Insights:</h4>
Extract meaningful insights from the visualizations and analysis.
Understand the peak booking periods and customer preferences.
Identify the relationship between waiting times and cancellation rates.
